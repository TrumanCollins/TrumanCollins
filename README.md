I'm Truman Collins (@TrumanCollins)

I started programming in about 1978, first on an HP calculator, then an Apple II+ computer.
I earned a BS in Math/Computer Science from Willamette University in 1986, then an MS in
Computer Science from Stanford in 1988.

I worked for 26 years as a software developer at Mentor Graphics that developed Electronic
Design Automation (EDA) software for computer chip design. I worked on VHDL Compilation,
Timing Analysis, Place and Route, and Geometric Analysis as part of their Calibre product.

I used C++ professionally for my entire career, but have learned several other languages
such as Scheme, Prolog, Perl, and Haskell.

I currently use Haskell almost exclusively for personal projects, some of which I have
added to GitHub. I find Haskell to be a conceptually powerful language with an uncluttered
and expressive syntax, lazy evaluation, and very good runtime performance.
